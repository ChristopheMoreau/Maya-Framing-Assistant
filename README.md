# Maya Framing Helper
 A Maya toolbox for composition and framing.

v1.1
I have added a more user friendly 2D/Pan zoom option and a "rounded UI". (click & drag for Pan and Wheel to Zoom In/Out)

###
Just drag & Drop the mel file in the Maya viewport for installation. It will create an icon in the current shelf tab.

You can add your own images in the pictures folder in png format (with alpha for transparency)
